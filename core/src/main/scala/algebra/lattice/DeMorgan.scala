/**
  * De Morgan algebras are bounded lattices that are also equipped with
  * an involutive `complement` operation.
  *
  * Complementation obeys the following law:
  *
  *  - ¬¬a = a
  *  - ¬(x∧y) = ¬x∨¬y
  *
  * However, in De Morgan algebras this operation is only a
  * pseudo-complement, since De Morgan algebras do not necessarily
  * provide the law of the excluded middle. This means that there is no
  * guarantee that (a ∨ ¬a) = 1. De Morgan algebra do not not necessarily
  * provide the law of non contradiction either. This means that there is
  * no guarantee that (a ∧ ¬a) = 0.
  *
  * De Morgan algebras are useful to model fuzzy logic. For a model of
  * classical logic, see the boolean algebra type class implemented as
  * `Bool`.
