/**
 * Ring consists of:

 *  - a commutative group for addition (+)
 *  - a monoid for multiplication (*)
 * 
 * Additionally, multiplication must distribute over addition.
 * 
 * Ring implements some methods (for example fromInt) in terms of
 * other more fundamental methods (zero, one and plus). Where
 * possible, these methods should be overridden by more efficient
 * implementations.
