# algebra

## the vision

This repo represents an attempt to unify the basic algebraic type
classes from [Spire](http://github.com/non/spire) and
[Algebird](http://github.com/twitter/algebird). By targeting just
these type classes, we will distribute an `algebra` package with no
dependencies that works with Scala 2.10 and 2.11, and which can be
shared by all Scala libraries interesting in abstract algebra.

## what we have so far

This repo has been seeded with most of the contents of
`spire.algebra`, and has been modified to fit an
initially-conservative and shared vision for algebraic type classes.
Discussions over removals and additions should take place on the issue
tracker or on relevant pull requests.

## participants

Anyone who wants to participate should feel free to send pull requests
to this repo. The following people have push access:

* Oscar Boykin
* Avi Bryant
* Lars Hupel
* Erik Osheim
* Tom Switzer

## development process

Please make a pull request against the master branch. For those that have merge access to the
repo, we follow these rules:

1. You may not merge your own PR unless `N` people have given you a shipit/+1 etc... and Travis CI is
   green.
2. If you are not the author, and you see `N-1` shipits and Travis CI is green, just click
merge and delete the branch.
3. N = 2.

## algebra overview

Algebra uses type classes to represent algebraic structures. You can
use these type classes to represent the abstract capabilities (and
requirements) you want generic parameters to possess.

This section will explain the structures available.

### algebraic properties and terminology

We will be talking about properties like *associativity* and
*commutativity*. Here is a quick explanation of what those properties
mean:

|Name         |Description                                                                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Associative  | If `⊕` is associative, then `a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)` = `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c)`.                    |
|Commutative  | If `⊕` is commutative, then `a ⊕ b` = `b ⊕ a`.                                 |
|Identity     | If `id` is an identity for `⊕`, then `a ⊕ id` = `id ⊕ a` = `a`.                |
|Inverse      | If `¬` is an inverse for `⊕` and `id`, then `a ⊕ ¬a` = `¬a ⊕ a` = `id`.        |
|Distributive | If `⊕` and `⊙` distribute, then `a ⊙ (b ⊕ c)` = `(a ⊙ b) ⊕ (a ⊙ c)` and `(a ⊕ b) ⊙ c` = `(a ⊙ c) ⊕ (b ⊙ c)`. |
|Idempotent   | If `⊕` is idempotent, then `a ⊕ (a ⊕ b)` = `(a ⊕ b)` and `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ b` = `(a ⊕ b)`. |

Though these properties are illustrated with symbolic operators, they
work equally-well with functions. When you see `a ⊕ b` that is
equivalent to `f(a, b)`: `⊕` is an infix representation of the binary
function `f`, and `a` and `b` are values (of some type `A`).

Similarly, when you see `¬a` that is equivalent to `g(a)`: `¬` is a
prefix representation of the unary function `g`, and `a` is a value
(of some type `A`).

### basic algebraic structures

The most basic structures can be found in the `algebra` package. They
all implement a method called `combine`, which is associative. The
identity element (if present) will be called `empty`, and the inverse
method (if present) will be called `inverse`.

|Name                |Associative?|Commutative?|Identity?|Inverse?|Idempotent?|

|CommutativeSemigroup|           ✓|           ✓|         |        |           |

|CommutativeGroup    |           ✓|           ✓|        ✓|       ✓|           |

properties and terminology](https://github.com/non/algebra/blob/master/README.md#algebraic-properties-and-terminology).)

### ring-like structures

The `algebra.ring` contains more sophisticated structures which
combine an *additive* operation (called `plus`) and a *multiplicative*
operation (called `times`). Additive identity and inverses will be
called `zero` and `negate` (respectively); multiplicative identity and
inverses will be called `one` and `reciprocal` (respectively).

Additionally some structures support a quotient operation, called
`quot`.

All ring-like structures are associative for both `+` and `*`, have
commutative `+`, and have a `zero` element (an identity for `+`).

|Name                |Has `negate`?|Has `1`?|Has `reciprocal`?|Has `quot`?|Commutative `*`?|
|--------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
|Semiring            |             |        |                 |           |                |
|Rng                 |            ✓|        |                 |           |                |
|Rig                 |             |       ✓|                 |           |                |
|CommutativeRig      |             |       ✓|                 |           |               ✓|
|Ring                |            ✓|       ✓|                 |           |                |
|CommutativeRing     |            ✓|       ✓|                 |           |               ✓|
|EuclideanRing       |            ✓|       ✓|                 |          ✓|               ✓|
|Field               |            ✓|       ✓|                ✓|          ✓|               ✓|

With the exception of `CommutativeRig` and `Rng`, every lower
structure is also an instance of the structures above it. For example,
every `Ring` is a `Rig`, every `Field` is a `CommutativeRing`, and so
on.
